<p>The day before, see if amp is charged by unplugging power cable and see if light flashes</p>
<p>To charge the amp: plug in the power, and turn the main switch on, check that the charge light is on.</p>
<p>Before the subject arrives, move the EGI cart into the scan room</p>
<h2 id="markdown-header-eeg-setup">EEG setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Turn on monitor computer, password is: geodesic [lowercase]</li>
<li>Open firefox, type in &rsquo;10.10.10.51&rsquo; to check signal on amp</li>
<li>
<p>Plug in clock sync orange cable [with black tip] + data cable [with white tip] + sys clck from the wall to the tan box</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prep solution &amp; cap &ndash; see EGI instructions</p>
</li>
<li>while the cap is soaking [with sensors facing in], go to the computer and open app -hook up egi computer</li>
<li>check in-room cable connections:</li>
<li>Black box : orange data cable to amp</li>
<li>Ethernet cable to laptop, right port
<ul>
<li>check on black box for the ports to light up -Amp &ndash; is on physically (switch back of amp)</li>
<li>by software, launch firefox (10.10.10.51)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markdown-header-capping">Capping</h2>
<ul>
<li>place cap on subject &ndash; see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.egi.com/knowledge-center/net-application">EGI instructions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.egi.com/knowledge-center/net-application/707-net-application-refresher-video">refresher video</a></li>
<li>get hands as wide as possible in the cap, then have your hands facing the ground to adjust, thumbs should be between 8, 14 and 21, 25 sensors</li>
<li>put the spandage on</li>
<li>cut hole for a face and tie on top, make sure to leave enough spandage for head</li>
<li>hook up cap &ndash; plug into amp, twist the knob shut, click on top left of the Net system to turn ON -look at impedances at Ohm tab, fix ones that look bad [if in rush, a few (~4) can be yellow, but never any red] -hook up EEG leads.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markdown-header-scan-setup">Scan setup</h2>
<h3 id="markdown-header-move-subject-into-scanner">Move subject into scanner</h3>
<ul>
<li>move cap/subject, amp, to scan room</li>
<li>stop measuring close to Ohm impendence, turn off app</li>
<li>turn off amp (otherwise will have to restart software), unplug all cords to amp</li>
<li>scan room [make sure 20ch base is on]</li>
<li>move chair to right side of bed, put amp on it</li>
<li>connect clock synch and eeg data cable to amp in scan room
<ul>
<li>connect subject leads, should come out beside the subject or by shoulder</li>
<li>attach physio on index finger and give pt button box</li>
<li>make sure amp no closer to machine than the divot on the base of the bed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="markdown-header-put-person-in">Put person in:</h3>
<ul>
<li>raise the bed and align the subject</li>
<li>to align the subject, turn on cross hair + button, then move the subject until the crosshair is between their eybrows</li>
<li>landmark the subject by pressing the round dial once</li>
<li>send the person into the scanner by pressing the round dial a second time (long press) -turn the amp back on before leaving the room</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="markdown-header-close-3t-door">Close 3T door.</h4>
<h3 id="markdown-header-back-in-the-console-room">Back in the console room:</h3>
<p>-plug in EGI data cable into the black box and clock synch fibre optic from the waveguide and bnc [clock cable 2], tr trigger - the tr trigger is the brown cable and gets plugged into the + OUT on trigger interface under counter -check firefox again to see if amp has warmed up - look at impedances to make sure they haven&rsquo;t changed</p>
<h3 id="markdown-header-start-scans">Start scans</h3>
<p>Registering pt on MRI console</p>
<ul>
<li>Check both 1st gradient boxes</li>
<li>EEG-fMRI</li>
<li>ETPB Repeat</li>
<li>
<p>Brain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rest scans, click the record red button on NET before start sequence on MRI console</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markdown-header-remove-patient-from-the-scanner">Remove patient from the scanner:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Press HOME button to auto move table out</li>
<li>Unplug the EEG cap from the amp</li>
<li>Remove top half of coil and the physio attachments from the subject</li>
<li>Have patient sit up and get off the bed</li>
<li>
<p>Unplug amp and cords connections to it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remove cap and disinfect</p>
</li>
<li>see EGI instructions:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.egi.com/knowledge-center/net-application/297-membership-net-removal-video">removal</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.egi.com/knowledge-center/net-application/296-membership-net-disinfection-video">disinfection</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markdown-header-when-done">When done</h2>
<ul>
<li>move amp back to cart</li>
<li>unplug EGI data cable from hole in the wall, and OUT cable, and clock signal</li>
<li>remember to plug amp back in and make sure that it is charging.</li>
<li>copy data to memory stick</li>
<li>transfer data to helix along with physio data</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="markdown-header-troubleshooting">TROUBLESHOOTING:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If need to quit NET on the monitor, force quit the app</li>
<li>To see if person is awake and using the button box, look at the top of the recording screen for selection on monitor</li>
<li>Plug laptop into the projector</li>
<li>Confirm the projector is on with the ON/OFF switch on the white box under the counter&mdash;press and hold until light comes up</li>
<li>Laptop with tasks needs tr trigger which is white USB cable from below counter, with &ldquo;button box&rdquo; sticker; tab to the instruction screen; THEN scan should trigger both computers</li>
<li>Autoconfig, then BGYRT letters setting. Use the dial to scroll and click in to select</li>
</ul>
